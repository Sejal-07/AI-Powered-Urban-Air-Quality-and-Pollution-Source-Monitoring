# AI-Powered-Urban-Air-Quality-and-Pollution-Source-Monitoring

üåç Project Overview <br>
Urban areas face challenges in monitoring air pollution in real time. Sparse sensors fail to capture hyper-local pollution sources, making it hard for authorities to act quickly.
This project is an AI-powered system that monitors urban air quality and identifies likely pollution sources using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

## Problem Statement 
- Cities struggle to pinpoint real-time, hyper-local sources of pollution such as:
- Illegal industrial emissions
- Construction dust
- Traffic congestion
- Limited sensor coverage prevents timely interventions and public awareness.

## üìä Dataset
### UrbanAirNet: Urban Air Quality and Weather Dataset
- Hourly pollutant concentrations: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3
- Weather info: temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Multiple urban monitoring stations
- Perfect for high-resolution temporal modeling

## Proposed Solution
Develop an integrated AI system that fuses environmental and contextual data to detect and predict pollution hotspots.
### Machine Learning (ML)
- Correlates real-time AQI data with traffic density, industrial activity patterns, and construction permits.
- Identifies patterns and relationships between pollutants and external factors.

### Deep Learning (DL)
- Predicts pollution dispersion patterns using historical and real-time data.
- Identifies the most likely source of pollution spikes considering wind direction, traffic flow, and historical emission trends.

## Outcome
- A real-time dashboard visualizing pollution hotspots.
- Alerts authorities to potential sources of pollution.
- Provides actionable insights for urban planning and policy-making.
